# Mythical Features

The tests in this repo require you to make API calls to a number of different services, each linked below.

This repo uses [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) to store API keys and protect them from being pushed to any version control system.

In order to get started, run `bundle` and then `rspec`. You should get a series of errors that will give you some idea of what to do next.

You may wish to run tests from a single file or a single test from a single file to further focus your work. The documentation below has been broken into three groups, depending on the level of challenge you'd like to pursue.
